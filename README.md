# Broccoli Run

An endless 2D runner game focused on a broccoli running from the tyranny of the Candy Kingdom.

In a world where most vegetables are extinct, some may be hiding, some might have died, and some might just be stupid... Broccoli man, a name he gave himself because his actual name is Timmy. A bored broccoli man decided to sneak away, and see Candyland for himself, rather than hide with the town people. Maybe it wasn't the best idea. His life is threatened when he is spotted by the dreadful candy pieces! Do you think you can keep him alive?
